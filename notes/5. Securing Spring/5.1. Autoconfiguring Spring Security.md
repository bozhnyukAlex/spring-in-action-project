# Autoconfiguring Spring Security
- **First thing:** add the Spring Boot security starter dependency to the build.
```xml
<dependency>  
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> 
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
- When the app starts, autoconfiguration will detect Spring Security in the classpath and will set some basic security configuration. 
- It enables **login page**, where you need to provide **login** and **password**. Login - User. Password you can find in log, it will be something like this:
```
Using generated security password: 087cfc6a-027d-44bc-95d7-cbb3a798a1ea
```
So, what do we have when just enabling security starter in project build?
-  All HTTP request paths require authentication.  
- No specific roles or authorities are required.  
- Authentication is prompted with a simple login page. 
- There’s only one user; the username is *user*.
This is good for many applications, **but we need to customize it and add some features:**
- Provide a login page that is designed to match the website. 
- Provide for multiple users, and enable a registration page so new Taco Cloud customers can sign up.
- Apply different security rules for different request paths. The home page and registration pages, for example, shouldn’t require authentication at all.
