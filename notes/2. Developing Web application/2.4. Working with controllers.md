# Working with controllers
HomeController does not has any `@PostMethod`, it has only method `@GetMapping` to display view. We can do following:
```java
 
@Configuration  
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
	@Override  
	public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
		registry.addViewController("/").setViewName("home"); 
	}
}
```
`WebMvcConfigurer` interface defines methods for configuring Spring MVC.
After that we can delete `HomeController` class.
Also we are able to make a class `TacoCloudApplication` implement this interface, so we won't need to make a new class `WebConfig`.
But we won't do that ro make bootstrap class clean and simple.
