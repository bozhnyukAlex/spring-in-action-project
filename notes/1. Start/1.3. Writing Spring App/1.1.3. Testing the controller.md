## Testing the controller
Spring has a powerfull test support.
In test we will perform GET request for root path and check following things:
- Response should have an HTTP 200 (OK) status
- The view should have a logical name of `home`.
- Rendered view should contain the text "Welcome to ..."
```java
@WebMvcTest(HomeController.class)  
public class HomeControllerTest {  
  
	 @Autowired  
	 private MockMvc mockMvc;  
	  
	 @Test  
	 public void testHomePage() throws Exception {  
	        mockMvc.perform(get("/"))  
	                .andExpect(status().isOk())  
	                .andExpect(view().name("home"))  
	                .andExpect(content().string(  
	                        containsString("Welcome to ...")));  
	 }  
	 
}
```
- `@WebMvcTest` - arranges for the test to run in context of a Spring MVC application. In this case, it arranges for `HomeController` to be registered in Spring MVC so that we can send requests to it. Also it sets ups Spring support for testing Spring MVC.
- This class is injected with a `MockMvc` to drive the mockup. Injection is made with `@Autowired` annotation.
- `testHomePage()` - method, that checks conditions we have described above.
