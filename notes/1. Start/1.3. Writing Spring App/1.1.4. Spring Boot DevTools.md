# Spring Boot DevTools
- Automatic application restart
Ability to make changes in Java code and properties files and see those changes applied after a moment.
We have two classloaders: one for project code, properies and anything in srs/main, other for dependency libraries. 
Changes: DevTools reloads only first classloader and restarts Spring application context.
-  Automatic browser refresh and template cache disable
Disable caches: you can change templates while running and then do refresh.
More: you don't need to do refresh. DevTools enables LiveReload server with ypir application. It causes browser to refresh automatically when changes are made.
- Built-in H2 console
For H2 database users. Enabling H2 console, it can be accessed from browser.
