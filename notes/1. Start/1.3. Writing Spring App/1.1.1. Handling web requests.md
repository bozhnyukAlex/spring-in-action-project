# Handling web requests
Here we start to work with **Spring MVC**. 
## Defining the controller
Center of Spring MVC is the concept of _controller_ - it handles requests and responds with some information.
Here is a controller class, that: 
- handles requests for root path (/)
- forwards those requests to the home page view, without populating any model data.
```java
package tacos;  
  
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;  
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;  
  
@Controller  
public class HomeController {
    
    @GetMapping("/")  
    public String home() {  
        return "home";  
	}  
}
``` 
- `@Controller` annotation: indentify this class as a component for component scanning. This scanning discovers it and creates HomeController instance as a bean in context. Note: `@Service`, `@Repository` and some other annotations work this way.
- `@GetMapping` annotation: `home()` method handles HTTP `GET` request, received for the root path `/`. 
- Method returns `String` value `home` . This is a logical name of a view. We will define this view with **Thymeleaf**.
